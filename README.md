# Background
I recently transitioned from the world of linguistics to the realm of software engineering. After owning a restaurant in Denver I became interested in the technologies that allowed my business to run from the point of sales system to the to go tablets used for online ordering. My journey, once paved with words and cultural nuances and meeting people in a fast paced environment, now finds expression in lines of code and the intricacies of software architecture. Like a linguist deciphering the layers of a foreign language, I navigate through the syntax and semantics of programming languages. I find these programming languages as sisters to spoken languages as they have their own syntax and ways of speaking. As I delve into the world of development, the linguistic insights I gained resonate, shaping not just the code I write but the way I approach problem-solving with a creative and analytical mindset. In this new chapter, my love for language finds a harmonious fusion with the logic and precision demanded by the world of software engineering.
