# Koopa Clash, a take on Rock, Paper, Scissors built with React and Tailwind 

> I decided to take on the challenge of making a version of rock, paper, scissors with React and incorporating Tailwind as well. This application is a tribute to the Mario Kart series of games using the items which are used in the game as tokens. Each difficulty lists which tokens are stronger so the user knows the rules when playing. The game is built for one player versus the computer. It keeps track of the winning status between the player and the computer as well.

> In using React this time in making the project, (I had previously done half of this project using vanilla Javascript) I found it easier to decide what components would be needed to achieve the desired game state at any given time. 

> Being the second time I've worked with Tailwind I had a easier time figuring out which properties were needed for the layout. I struggled with dealing with responsiveness though and decided that the only way to get the CSS how I wanted it was making classes for each screen size. This seems to work but I do wonder if there's an easier way to do it. I will do further research to find out.
