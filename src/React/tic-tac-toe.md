# Tic-Tac-Toe with React 

> I built a princess version of tic-tac-toe in React for my daughter. The first time I built this application it was in pure vanilla javascript so this gave me a great opportunity to work on my react skills. I split my game up into 4 major components that worked together in creating the application. I implemented a score calculator and have diabled the boxes after a game is won. 

> I learned more about how components interact with one antoher using props. I passed down certain props like score and gameboard from the main App file to the players and board components. This allows players to interact with the board while in the background the score is being calculated.

>The gameboard runs with a useEffect that check each token placed and determines whether a win is made.
