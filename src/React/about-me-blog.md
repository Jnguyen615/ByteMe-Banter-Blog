# About Me Blog with Next/TypeScript/Tailwind

> I built a basic about me blog using Next.js, Tailwind, and Typescript. I followed a tutorial for this as well and had some outside help debugging errors. 

> I learned more about the differences between the different types of rendering. Server side renders the initial HTML for a page and sends it to the client allowing search engines to crawl and index the content. With client side rendering the initial HTML is mininal and the page content is generated dynamically by the JavaScript running in the browser. Static site generation is where the HTML is generated at build time and then served statically to the client. Incremental Static Regeneration is an extension of static site generation that allows pages to be generated at runtime based on user requests. Choosing the right type depends on the nature of the application being created. 

> Using TypeScript again gave me insight into how types would work in an application such as this one and how important they are in the life of the application. Type checking enusres that variables, funcitons, and expressions in your code adhere to the specified types defined in the programming language you are writing in.  

> This was my first experience with Tailwind and it is tedious to learn a whole new syntax of rules but I can see the benefit of having it all nested within the component. I will do some more work with tailwind.
