# Travel Blog using React and Bootstrap 

> I followed a tutorial using React and Bootstrap to create a travel blog, which logs trips and gives users a way to include information about each trip. 

> I installed bootstrap per instrucions in the tutorial and I found it to be simple but not necessarily something I need to worry about as I already know CSS, SaSS and Tailwind. It was nice to see it, however I didn't get to deep into it with this scale of a project.
